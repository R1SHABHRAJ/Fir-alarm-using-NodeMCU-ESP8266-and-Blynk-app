# Fire Alarm

This project is a fire alarm system that uses an ESP8266 microcontroller and Blynk app to detect and alert users of a fire. The system uses an fire/infrared sensor to detect the presence of fire and a servo motor to trigger an alarm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to do the following:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `fire_alarm.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your ESP8266 microcontroller to your computer via USB.
4. Compile and upload the code to your microcontroller.
5. Open the Blynk app on your smartphone and scan the QR code provided in the `fire_alarm.ino` file.
6. Once the app is connected to your microcontroller, you can start using the fire alarm system.

## Usage

The fire alarm system is designed to detect the presence of fire and trigger an alarm. When the infrared sensor detects fire, the servo motor will trigger an alarm and the Blynk app will send a notification to your smartphone.
